# Challenge  - Export and Anonymize Data
The biostatistics program at Sunnyville University regularly partners with Sunrise Healthcare on medical research projects. They are interested in studying yearly Flu trends. Since the use case is academic and not for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, the biostatisticians cannot have access to PHI. In this challenge you will review the data in your FHIR server, determine the minimal necessary data for the Sunnyville University biostatisticans and export the data anonymized based on the HIPAA Safe Harbor specifications.
